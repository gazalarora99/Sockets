Testcases represent the messages written to or read from the socket stream based on the current message state, they don't represent output.
All messages are sent without a null terminator and without a new line character.
Read will block if a message like REG|12|Who's there? is received as read will wait
for the last byte that is a vertical bar '|' after reading 12 characters (msg length) in order to determine end of the message
We do not have to take care of avoiding such a read block case as mentioned on Piazza post @329 by professor.
When waiting for a new connection, server prints: Waiting for new client connection to start KKJ
When closing a connection based on error messages received or sent, server outputs to inform closing connection.
